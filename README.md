# Chinampa Farming

## Description

This RimWorld mod introduces the ancient farming technique of chinampas, or "floating gardens". Now, players can utilize swampy and watery areas for productive agriculture, just like the Aztecs did. (Note that chinampa do not require bridges, they are bridges for plants essentially.)

The chinampa is a versatile plant mat-based agricultural tool used in many regions worldwide. Even today, some communities farming swamps would certainly recognize what a chinampa is and understand how to work it if confronted with one.

For the full farming experience, it is highly recommended to pair this mod with the [Grass is Still Hay](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2882481802) mod. It provides an early source of hay by cutting grass, making chinampa farming practical in environments where it would otherwise be impossible.
